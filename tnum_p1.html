A scientist presented a theory of four dimensions and time travel to the guests at a dinner party. He believed that the world was not three dimensional, but a four dimensional space containing the dimension of time. According to this corollary, since people can move in three-dimensional space, they should also be able to travel through the tunnel of time. People can go back in time or advance into the future. The time traveler said he built a time machine and flew it to the year in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. 

In this future world, the time traveler meets the future humans. “He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much.” “And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild.” The time traveller later learns that these people were called Eloi, and that they were strict vegetarians who ate fruit because in the distant future horses, cows, sheep, and dogs all followed the ichthyosaurs into extinction. When he gets along with the Eloi, he finds them thin and lacking in intelligence. Perhaps because they are comfortable and secure, they don't do any work. There is no sign of struggle, neither social nor economic. He did not have a good impression of them. He thought they were not curious about things and were very lazy. He thought he never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued than the Eloi. 
When night came, the time traveler suddenly found that his time machine had been stolen. He initially thinks the Eloi stole it.  He was reassured by their physical and mental inadequacies, because he hid the attachment of the levers to the time machine. Later, he knew that the Morlocks took it. On that day, the time traveler made a friend called Weena, he rescued her from a swiftly current. The time traveler was obsessed with retrieving the time machine and leaving the future world. There are signs that the time machine may be hidden by Morlocks. Despite Weena's attempts to dissuade him, he overcomes his fears and travels to the underworld in search of a time machine. Then he saw clearly what another branch of the human race looked like “I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces.  You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!” By exploring underground Wells leading to the Morlocks, apelike cavemen who lived underground in darkness and only surfaced at night. They also possess astonishing industrial and mechanical skills that make Eloi's heavenly life possible. Lacking other food, they fed on Eloi. They spent the night in the forest. They were then defeated by the Morlocks during the night, and Verna fainted as a result. When the Morlocks were distracted by the small fire he left behind, the traveler escaped. The time traveler and Weena spent the night in the forest. They are then defeated by the Morlocks during the night, and Weena passes out. When the Morlocks were distracted by the fire he left behind, the traveler escaped, but Weena didn’t. The Morlocks opened the White Sphinx and tried to capture the Traveler using the time machine as bait, but they didn't know he would use it to escape. He tricked his way into the house, successfully activated the time machine and left the world. When he returned to the present world, the audience did not believe him, and he showed the flowers that Weena had put in his pocket to prove that he was telling the truth.
